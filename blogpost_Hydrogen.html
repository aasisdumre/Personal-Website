         <p class="font3">Currently, industrialized nations are utilizing fossil fuels to produce hydrogen fuel cells for automobiles and fertilizers, known as "grey" or "black" hydrogen. However, an alternative method known as "blue" hydrogen technology, in which a substantial portion of the carbon emitted is captured, is being employed in countries such as Japan. Nonetheless, the high cost of gas has hindered its widespread adoption.</p><br>

	<li><b> Types of Hydrogen Production  </b></li></div>
	<br>
	<p class="font3">One of the most promising forms of hydrogen is "green" hydrogen, which is generated through electrolysis and is considered to be a carbon-neutral energy source. However, the method is currently capital-intensive and necessitates substantial cost reductions to become more viable. Emanuele Taibi of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) stated that green hydrogen could potentially experience a decrease in cost similar to that of solar photovoltaics.
	Nepal, like many other nations, is still in the nascent stages of developing its hydrogen fuel production and distribution infrastructure. Nevertheless, the country possesses a significant potential for hydrogen to play a role in its energy mix. Hydrogen boasts a high energy density, can be derived from various feedstocks using a plethora of production techniques, and when combusted, it only produces water, making it a clean and environmentally friendly fuel. A recent study shows that Nepal has the potential to produce the most competitive green hydrogen energy by 2032, if the country begins transitioning into a green economy and develops policy decisions on greening Nepal now. The government entities such as Nepal Oil Corporation, Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, Hydropower companies, and the Norwegian Governmentâ€™s NORHED II have supported these research activities.

        <p class="font3">In the transportation sector, hydrogen has the potential to be utilized as fuel for cars, buses, and other vehicles. Fuel cell vehicles, which use hydrogen to generate electricity, have already been developed and employed in some parts of the world. They possess the advantage of being silent, efficient, and emission-free, making them a potentially appealing alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.</p>
         <br><p class="font3">In conclusion, the future of hydrogen as a fuel looks promising. While there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the need for infrastructure and the high cost of production (approximately US$1.17 per kg in Nepal and US$3 per kg in the rest of the world), the potential benefits of hydrogen make it an exciting area of research and development. As a country, Nepal can capitalize on this potential by investing in green hydrogen technology and infrastructure, positioning itself as a leader in the clean energy industry.
